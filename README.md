# esp2866-weather

This is a little project that I started when I discoved the little ESP8266 wifi capable arduino boards.  You could probably just do away with the DHT-22 humidity sensor if you want to save 10 bux.  I used it because at the time the BMP-180 didn't have a very accurage pressure sensor.  But that has changed with the newer BME280 chips. 

I've also included my little case for sliding in a pcb board with the components on it.  I originally glued this onto a solar panel/ usb battery.  But the solar panel sucked so it was basically just a battery.  I plan to build my own panel and charger system eventually and add that to the project.

You can download the free Splunk version which limits the amount of data you collect each day, but it's plenty for doing weather data. Download this at splunk.com.  Or you can just use an Wunderground.com account to make your own weather station.  Enter in your account info into the .ino file along with your wifi SSID and Password.

I'll keep trying to improve the instructions and other stuff here as I get time.


Enjoy,
